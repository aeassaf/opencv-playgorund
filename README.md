# OpenCV Playground â€“ Personal Computer Vision Projects

A collection of small personal projects exploring core concepts of computer vision using Python and OpenCV.
This playground was built while following the free Computer Vision course by the University of Washington (on YouTube), and includes experiments with filters, edge detection, object tracking, contour finding, and more.
